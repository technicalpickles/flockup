factory_girl_on_rails
=====================

factory_girl_on_rails provides some minor creature comforts for using factory_girl on a Rails project:

 * Automatically load factories in RAILS_ROOT/test/factories
 * A generator for putting new factories in RAILS_ROOT/test/factories


Installing
==========

    script/plugin install git://github.com/technicalpickles/factory_girl_on_rails.git

Example
=======

After installing this plugin, you just start using factories in RAILS_ROOT/test/factories.

As a convenience, a factory generator is provided:

`./script/generate factory account`

    creates an Account factory: test/factories/account_factory.rb

`./script/generate factory post title:string body:text published:boolean`

    creates a Post factory with a string title, text body, and published flag.
