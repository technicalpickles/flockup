h1. factory_girl_on_rails

bq. factory_girl_on_rails provides some minor creature comforts for using factory_girl on a Rails project:

* Automatically load factories in either RAILS_ROOT/test/factories or RAILS_ROOT/spec/factories
* A generator for putting new factories in either RAILS_ROOT/test/factories or RAILS_ROOT/spec/factories


h2. Installing

<pre>script/plugin install git://github.com/negonicrac/factory_girl_on_rails.git</pre>

Adds the required include or statments

*tests*
<pre>require 'factory_girl_on_rails'</pre>

*specs*
<pre>config.include FactoryGirlOnRails</pre>

h2. Example

After installing this plugin, you just start using factories in RAILS_ROOT/test/factories.

As a convenience, a factory generator is provided:

*Tests*
<pre>./script/generate factory account</pre>

creates an Account factory: test/factories/account_factory.rb

<pre>./script/generate factory post title:string body:text published:boolean</pre>

creates a Post factory with a string title, text body, and published flag.

*Specs -- if spec directory is defined*
<pre>./script/generate factory account</pre>

creates an Account factory: spec/factories/account_factory.rb

<pre>./script/generate factory post title:string body:text published:boolean</pre>

creates a Post factory with a string title, text body, and published flag.
