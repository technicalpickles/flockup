    Welcome to the
    %span.flock= @flock.name
    flock.
    - unless @flock.description.blank?
      Here's what we know about it:
      %i= %Q("#{h(@flock.description)}")

%div{:class => 'span-22'}
  - if @flock.flockers.size > 2 # there's always going to be 1, because we 'build' a flocker
    %p
      And here's everyone that's flocked to it...
    = render :partial => 'flockers/table', :locals => {:flockers => @flock.flockers.not_invalid.paginate(:page => params[:page])}
              
    %p Like what you see? Maybe you should follow some of these flockers. To do so, click through each flocker's twitter page, and follow them by hand. Confused? <a href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=76">Read more about what followers and following is all about</a>.
    
    %p How about adding someone else?
